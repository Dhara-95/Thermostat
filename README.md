# Thermostat Challenge

**Specification**

```
- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage. ( low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)
- Additional functionality added to get an AJAX request from a 'current-weather' API, that prints the current weather of a city that a user has submitted in a form.
